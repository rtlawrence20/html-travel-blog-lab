        Recently, I paid a visit to Fire Island National Seashore—a land that seems completely out of place,<br> 
        secretly located just beyond New York City. I felt as if time had warped and I’d been transported to the past.<br>  
        Scarcely a whisper of urban cacophony, the island thrummed to a different beat—soft, measured, and uncluttered. <br> 
        I walked alone along wind-swept beaches with the sound of the waves my only companion. <br> 
        I walked through the Sunken Forest, where twisted holly trees loomed above me. <br> 
        It was there, in the shadowy tunnels beneath the green canopy, that I did something I hadn't done in years: <br> 
        breathed in the stillness and felt a sense of renewal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sentinel of both natural and cultural treasures, Fire Island proudly bears its cloak. <br> 
        Sailors Haven and Watch Hill are not merely quaint attractions but historic sites. <br> 
        The Fire Island Lighthouse is a monolith against the nimbus pocked skies, <br> 
        and horizons appear to stretch well past the end of the world. Fire Island is not just a place to visit; <br> 
        it's a place that changes the way you view the world around you.
